# Task state — PelizzAI

## Progress

- scope: planning only — restore legacy visual/navigational parity in the Angular renderer,
  unblock screen switching, expose the AI key inputs in Settings, settle the unfocus behavior.
  No product code in this task.
- done: reproduction (app does not boot — ESM/electron named import), discovery closed with 5
  ratified decisions, spec written, plan written with 10 vertical tasks
- next: plan content approval by the user → post-plan setup gate of `pelizzai-execution-plans`
- open gaps: none blocking; residuals listed in the plan under `## Exposed material gaps`
